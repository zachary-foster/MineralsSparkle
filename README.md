# Minerals Sparkle

Adds crystals that can be mined for valuable gems, particularly in remote and extreme biomes.

- Make exploring caves and mountains more rewarding and makes underground environments more interesting
- Rough gems are mined from crystals and can be cut to provide a valuable lightweight currency or sold as is
- Fossils can be found in sedimentary rock and can be sold to the decerning collector for a good price
- Valuable crystals are more likely to be found in extreme biomes and far from settlements
- Rare giant crystals and fossils can be extracted by skilled miners and used as decoration or to provide a small bonus to research (make a museum!)
