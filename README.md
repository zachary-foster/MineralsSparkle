# MineralsRock - Overhaul of RimWorld's rocks, mountains, and mining mechanics

* Adds weathered rocks on the boarders of mountains and more solid rocks the deeper you go in (based on roof presence/thickness).
* Makes rocks more distinct in terms of hit points, beauty, and ease of mining.
* Adds Basalt, since its the most abundant rock on Earth, and ensure it occurs in volcanic biomes.
* Adds river rocks that accumulate near streams
