Version 0.1.0

Adds crystals that can be mined for valuable gems, particularly in remote and extreme biomes.

- Make exploring caves and mountains more rewarding and makes underground environments more interesting
- Rough gems are mined from crystals and can be cut to provide a valuable lightweight currency or sold as is
- Fossils can be found in sedimentary rock and can be sold to the decerning collector for a good price
- Valuable crystals are more likely to be found in extreme biomes and far from settlements
- Rare giant crystals and fossils can be extracted by skilled miners and used as decoration or to provide a small bonus to research (make a museum!)

See other mods in the "Minerals" collection to get the full experience:

- **Minerals Rock**: Complete overhaul of mountains and rocks
- **Minerals Frozen**: Dynamic ice and snow that can be used for building and cooling rooms

The Minerals mods are still being balanced. Feel free to let me know if anything needs to be adjusted!

I am not aware of any incompatibilities with other mods, but please let me know if you find any.

Requires "Minerals Framework" mod to function.
